# CYBER-POLICE
Cybercrime is defined as a crime in which a computer is the object of the crime (hacking, phishing, spamming) or is used as a tool to commit an offense (child pornography, hate crimes). Criminals who perform these illegal activities are often referred to as hackers. Cybercrime may also be referred to as computer crime
 
 The CYBER-POLICE built on Django framework provides platform for victims of cyber crime to report issues 
which will be taken up a registered counseller. The communication between the victim and counseller can take place through a video call or text chat implemented by WEB RTC. If the victim is satisfied by the actions taken by the counseller, he can then close his case.

The prerequisite packages to be installed are given in the requirements.txt file.
